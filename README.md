#### Purpose, Target Audience & Features

The purpose of this website portfolio is to outline my skills, work history, personality, and contact information for the target audience, which in this case is a potential client or employer. To help them gain a better understanding of who i am and what i have to offer. It is also a way to showcase my experience, what i have learned, my design skills and my ability to write code using HTML and CSS. 

When it comes to the functionality, features and design of my Portfolio, I wanted to keep it as simple as possible, displaying a minimal aesthetic while still keeping to brief and providing all the information a potential client or employer would require to gain a strong enough understanding about me. 

Each page shares a common theme through-out with a dark cubular background, a navigation bar located on the top right of the screen with white text and hover over effects displaying orange highlights. This is to add contrast and help draw the eye and the users attention to important factors such as titles and names. The hover effect is is also used in this context to add a sense of clickability to the words in the navigation bar to help further direct the users attention to the other pages on the website. Each page also has a resume button, and a social icon for both GitHub and Linkedin located in the bottom center. These link externally to my profiles for each, and a pdf of my resume. I placed these on each page to insure continuity and help the user have access to this information at any time.

##### Home Page

When the user first enters the home page of my Portfolio they will be welcomed with a short and simple message; 
(***hey, my name is Mitchell Painter, i'm a web developer bringing big ideas to life.***) This is a simple, yet affectve intro to set the stage and welcome the user, giving them a basic idea of its purpose and what information they might find. 

##### About Me

If the user clicks through to ***About Me***, they will find a brief description about who i am, what i do, my expertise and a small image of me. This is to help the user learn more about me, create a welcoming environment, and let them in to my life, my background and what i enjoy doing when i'm not working on exciting new projects. The About Me page follows the general theme and has white text for the most part, with orange highlighted text to exentuate my skills.

##### Blog Page

The ***Blog*** page displays a list of 5 different blog posts with an image, title, and day it was published. Once again these titles are displayed with white text and have a hover over effect that increases the image and titles size as the user moves the mouse over them. This also helps create a sense of motion and clickability and shows that these titles if clicked will take them to further information, in this case the selected blog post. If the user selects a blog post, they will arrive on that perticuler blogs page, which contains a larger version of it's title image and more in depth text. Within each blog post is a back button, which will take you back to the main 'blog' page if you wish to select and read a different blog.

##### Contact

The final page on my Portfolio website is the ***contact*** page. This is where the user will find a simple and affectice (***let's work together..***) Below this heading is a form whereby the user is prompted to insert their name, email address, and a short message if they would like to contact me or have an interest in working together. Below the form is a submit button and my email address if there were ever any issues with using the form or opening my resume, where all of my contact information is listed. Each box in the form is grey, keeping it semi-blended with the background and contains a hover effect to display the boxes white when the mouse moves over them, to further prompt the user to click and fill out the form.
